It is my initial learning project in this project not have any unique and different thing and I know you are thinking this is a basic type and low level app but I learn to many thing from this project and
it build my fundamental strong so that in future I will make a unique app which is really unique and help someone.
  
  <br>
<br>
  Now I tell you about App.
<br>
<br>
  This is a type of application where you can save your thoughts and ideas which you forget quickly. This is similar to note application but I made it from scratch and I added some features in this app which is not there in any other note application even though it is similar to note application

## Difference From Other Notes App
<il>
  <h3><li>App UI Color Change in Certain Time</li></h3>
</il>

<p>You can see the header color, item hold border color and note down notes icon background color. It is not stay same every time, the app  change color automatically so that you can not feel bore from the same color problem which is happened every notes application. The UI color change after the certain time so that you will see new UI color every time when you will open the app after an hour or as your wish.</p>

<il>
  <h3><li>Note Screen Background Image</li></h3>
</il>
<p>When you want to Write the thought and you will go to Note Screen then you will see a background image which is illustrate your thinking and motivate you to write your ideas which you forget quickly.
This background image is not staying same every time it will chanage evry time whenever you will open the Note Screen for write the notes then you will see new image.
</p>

  <h3><li>Delete Icon Animation</li></h3>
</il>
